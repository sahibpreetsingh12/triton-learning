# GPU Performance Optimization Guide

## The 4 Pillars of GPU Performance

### 1. **Memory Access Patterns** üéØ
**What it means:** How your program reads/writes data from GPU memory

**Good Patterns:**
- **Coalesced access**: Adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations
- **Sequential reads**: Reading memory in order (1,2,3,4... not 1,3,2,4...)
- **Consistent patterns**: Same access pattern across all programs

**Bad Patterns:**
- **Scattered access**: Random memory locations
- **Strided access**: Reading every Nth element with large N
- **Inconsistent calculations**: Different pointer math in load vs store

**Example from your code:**
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Inconsistent patterns
input_ptr = X_ptr + pid*m_stride + offsets*n_stride    # Row+Col order
output_ptr = Y_ptr + offsets*n_stride + pid*m_stride   # Col+Row order

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Consistent patterns  
x_ptrs = X_ptr + row_idx * row_stride + col_offsets    # Always Row+Col
y_ptrs = Y_ptr + row_idx * row_stride + col_offsets    # Same pattern
```

### 2. **Computational Efficiency** ‚ö°
**What it means:** Minimizing wasted calculations and operations

**Optimizations:**
- **Eliminate redundant calculations**: Calculate once, reuse
- **Use efficient operations**: `x * x` instead of `x ** 2` in Triton
- **Minimize divisions**: Division is slower than multiplication
- **Vectorized operations**: Process multiple elements at once

**Example from your code:**
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Redundant pointer calculations
input_ptr = X_ptr + pid*m_stride + offsets*n_stride   # Calculated here
# ... later ...
output_ptr = Y_ptr + offsets*n_stride + pid*m_stride  # Calculated again!

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Calculate once, reuse
ptrs = base_ptr + row_idx * row_stride + col_offsets  # Once
data = tl.load(ptrs, mask=mask)                       # Use
tl.store(ptrs_out, result, mask=mask)                 # Reuse concept
```

### 3. **Occupancy** üë•
**What it means:** How many programs/threads run simultaneously on the GPU

**Key Factors:**
- **Block size**: Larger blocks = better occupancy (up to a point)
- **Register usage**: Too many variables = fewer concurrent programs
- **Shared memory usage**: Limited resource shared among programs
- **Program complexity**: Complex programs = fewer can run together

**Rules of Thumb:**
- Target 75%+ occupancy for good performance
- Block sizes of 128-1024 often work well
- Balance block size vs register/memory usage

### 4. **Kernel Launch Overhead** üöÄ
**What it means:** The "startup cost" of launching a GPU kernel

**Factors:**
- **Number of kernel launches**: Each launch has overhead
- **Data transfer**: CPU‚ÜîGPU transfers are expensive
- **Synchronization**: Waiting for GPU to finish

**Optimizations:**
- **Fuse operations**: Combine multiple steps into one kernel
- **Minimize launches**: One big kernel > many small kernels
- **Overlap computation**: Hide transfers behind computation
- **Batch operations**: Process more data per launch

## Memory Bound vs Compute Bound Operations

### **Memory Bound Operations** üìä
**Definition:** Performance limited by how fast you can read/write data

**Characteristics:**
- **Simple math**: Basic operations like add, subtract, copy
- **Low arithmetic intensity**: Few operations per byte of data
- **GPU cores are idle**: Waiting for memory access
- **Bandwidth bottleneck**: Limited by memory speed, not compute speed

**Examples:**
- **Vector addition**: `c[i] = a[i] + b[i]` (3 memory ops, 1 math op)
- **Element-wise operations**: ReLU, sigmoid on tensors
- **Data copying/reshaping**: Transpose, concatenation  
- **Reductions**: Sum, max across arrays (reading >> computing)
- **Your layer normalization**: Mostly memory access, simple math

**Optimization Focus:**
- ‚úÖ **Memory access patterns** (coalescing, caching)
- ‚úÖ **Reduce memory transfers** (fuse operations)
- ‚ùå More compute cores won't help much

### **Compute Bound Operations** üßÆ  
**Definition:** Performance limited by how fast you can do calculations

**Characteristics:**
- **Complex math**: Expensive operations like sqrt, exp, trigonometry
- **High arithmetic intensity**: Many operations per byte of data
- **Memory system keeps up**: Can feed data fast enough
- **Compute bottleneck**: Limited by calculation speed, not memory

**Examples:**
- **Matrix multiplication**: `C = A @ B` (lots of multiply-accumulate)
- **Convolutions**: Complex neighborhood calculations
- **FFT/Signal processing**: Heavy mathematical operations
- **Neural network training**: Backpropagation with many gradients
- **Scientific simulations**: Physics calculations, numerical methods

**Optimization Focus:**
- ‚úÖ **More compute units** (larger GPUs help a lot)  
- ‚úÖ **Efficient algorithms** (reduce FLOPs)
- ‚úÖ **Vectorization** (SIMD operations)
- ‚ùå Memory optimizations have less impact

## How to Identify What You're Dealing With

### **Quick Test: The "Arithmetic Intensity" Check**
```
Arithmetic Intensity = Operations per Byte of Data

If AI < 1:     Memory Bound (most operations)
If AI > 10:    Compute Bound  
If 1 < AI < 10: Hybrid (optimize both)
```

### **Example Analysis:**

**Layer Normalization (Memory Bound):**
```
Per element: 1 load + 1 store + ~5 math ops = 2 memory ops, 5 compute ops
AI = 5 ops / (2 * 4 bytes) = 0.625 ops/byte ‚Üí Memory Bound
```

**Matrix Multiplication (Compute Bound):**
```  
For N√óN matrices: 2N¬≥ multiply-add ops, 3N¬≤ memory accesses
AI = 2N¬≥ / (3N¬≤ * 4 bytes) = N/6 ops/byte
For N=1024: AI = 170 ops/byte ‚Üí Heavily Compute Bound
```

### **Performance Implications:**

**Memory Bound:**
- Triton often struggles vs PyTorch (PyTorch has years of memory optimization)
- Focus on data layout, access patterns, kernel fusion
- Bigger GPU ‚â† much faster (same memory bandwidth)

**Compute Bound:**  
- Triton can excel (direct control over compute)
- Focus on algorithmic efficiency, vectorization
- Bigger GPU = much faster (more compute units)

**Your Layer Norm Experience:**
- Memory bound operation
- Triton competitive on large data (better patterns)
- PyTorch wins on small data (kernel launch optimization)
- This is expected and normal!

## Key Takeaway
**Know your bottleneck.** Memory-bound operations need memory optimizations. Compute-bound operations need algorithmic optimizations. Trying to optimize the wrong bottleneck wastes time!
