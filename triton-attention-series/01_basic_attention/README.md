# Blog Post 1: Basic Attention in Triton - Understanding the Fundamentals

Welcome to the first post in our Triton attention optimization series! In this post, we'll implement attention from scratch using Triton, focusing on understanding rather than performance.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this post, you'll understand:
- How attention works at the GPU kernel level
- Basic Triton programming concepts
- The standard attention algorithm implementation
- How to verify correctness against PyTorch

## üß† The Attention Algorithm

Attention computes: **`Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/‚àöd)V`**

Our kernel breaks this down into steps:
1. For each query position `i`:
   - Load query vector `Q[i]`
   - Compute attention scores against all keys
   - Apply softmax normalization
   - Compute weighted sum of values
   - Store result

## üíª Implementation Walkthrough

### Kernel Structure

```python
@triton.jit
def basic_attention_kernel(
    Q_ptr, K_ptr, V_ptr, Output_ptr,
    seq_len, d_model, scale,
    BLOCK_SIZE_SEQ: tl.constexpr,
    BLOCK_SIZE_DIM: tl.constexpr
):
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **One thread per query**: Each GPU thread handles one query position
- **Sequential processing**: Load keys/values one at a time (inefficient but clear)
- **Simple indexing**: Straightforward memory access patterns

### Memory Access Pattern

```python
# Thread assignment
query_idx = tl.program_id(0)  # Which query am I handling?

# Load my query vector
q_ptrs = Q_ptr + query_idx * d_model + dim_offsets
query = tl.load(q_ptrs, mask=dim_mask, other=0.0)

# Loop through all keys (inefficient!)
for k_idx in range(seq_len):
    k_ptrs = K_ptr + k_idx * d_model + dim_offsets
    key = tl.load(k_ptrs, mask=dim_mask, other=0.0)
    # ... compute score
```

**Why This Is Inefficient:**
- Each key/value vector is loaded `seq_len` times (once per query)
- Total redundant memory operations: `O(seq_len¬≤)`
- We'll fix this in the next blog post!

## üî¨ Correctness Verification

Our implementation matches PyTorch exactly:

```bash
‚úÖ Correctness Test Results:
   Input shape: torch.Size([16, 64])
   Max difference: 0.000002
   Mean difference: 0.000001
   Within tolerance: True ‚úÖ
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Baseline

```bash
‚è±Ô∏è  Basic Performance Test
Basic Triton: 15.23 ms
PyTorch:      2.45 ms
Slowdown:     6.2x slower üêå
```

**That's Expected!**
- PyTorch uses highly optimized CUDA kernels
- Our implementation prioritizes education over performance
- We're building the foundation for optimization

## üéì Key Triton Concepts Learned

### 1. Program ID and Thread Assignment
```python
query_idx = tl.program_id(0)  # Get my unique thread ID
```

### 2. Memory Loading with Masks
```python
dim_mask = dim_offsets < d_model  # Handle variable sizes
query = tl.load(q_ptrs, mask=dim_mask, other=0.0)
```

### 3. Vectorized Operations
```python
score = tl.sum(query * key) * scale  # Dot product + scaling
```

### 4. Conditional Updates
```python
scores = tl.where(score_mask, score, scores)  # Update specific position
```

## üöÄ What's Next?

Our basic implementation works but has performance issues:

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Redundant memory loads (each key loaded `seq_len` times)
- ‚ùå Sequential processing (not using GPU parallelism)
- ‚ùå Poor memory access patterns (cache misses)

**Solutions (Next Blog Post):**
- ‚úÖ Vectorized loading (load all keys at once)
- ‚úÖ Broadcasting for parallel computation
- ‚úÖ Memory coalescing improvements

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Code

```bash
cd 01_basic_attention/
python basic_attention.py
```
