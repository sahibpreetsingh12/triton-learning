# Blog Post 2: Vectorized Attention in Triton - Performance Through Parallelism

Building on our basic implementation, this post demonstrates the transformative power of vectorization in GPU programming. We'll eliminate redundant operations and achieve significant speedups!

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this post, you'll understand:
- How vectorization eliminates redundant memory operations
- Broadcasting techniques for parallel computation
- Memory coalescing and cache optimization
- Practical GPU performance optimization strategies

## ⚡ The Vectorization Revolution

### The Problem with Basic Attention

Our basic implementation had a critical inefficiency:

```python
# Basic version - loads each key multiple times!
for k_idx in range(seq_len):
    key = tl.load(K_ptr + k_idx * d_model + dim_offsets)  # Load one key
    score = tl.sum(query * key)  # Compute one score
```

**Result**: Each key vector gets loaded `seq_len` times (once per query)

### The Vectorized Solution

```python
# Vectorized version - loads ALL keys at once!
k_ptrs = K_ptr + seq_offsets[:, None] * d_model + dim_offsets[None, :]
all_keys = tl.load(k_ptrs, mask=seq_mask[:, None] & dim_mask[None, :])
scores = tl.sum(query[None, :] * all_keys, axis=1) * scale  # ALL scores at once!
```

**Result**: Each key vector loaded exactly once, all computations in parallel

## 🧠 Understanding Broadcasting Magic

The key innovation is using broadcasting for 2D memory access:

```python
# Create 2D addressing grid
seq_offsets[:, None]    # Shape: [seq_len, 1] - column vector
dim_offsets[None, :]    # Shape: [1, d_model] - row vector
# Broadcasting creates [seq_len, d_model] grid of addresses!
```

**Memory Layout Visualization:**
```
k_ptrs = [
    [K[0,0], K[0,1], K[0,2], ..., K[0,d_model-1]],    # Key 0
    [K[1,0], K[1,1], K[1,2], ..., K[1,d_model-1]],    # Key 1
    ...
    [K[seq_len-1,0], ..., K[seq_len-1,d_model-1]]     # Key seq_len-1
]
```

## 📊 Performance Results

## 🔬 Memory Efficiency Analysis

### Before vs After Comparison

**Basic Version (Inefficient):**
```
For seq_len=512, d_model=128:
- Memory loads per query: 512 keys + 512 values = 1,024 loads
- Total redundant loads: 512 queries × 1,024 loads = 524,288 loads
- Memory traffic: ~268 MB of redundant data movement
```

**Vectorized Version (Efficient):**
```
For seq_len=512, d_model=128:
- Memory loads per query: 1 all-keys load + 1 all-values load = 2 loads
- Total efficient loads: 512 queries × 2 loads = 1,024 loads
- Memory traffic: ~0.5 MB of necessary data movement
- Improvement: 512x reduction in memory operations!
```

## 💻 Implementation Deep Dive

### Vectorized Attention Scores

```python
# OLD: Sequential computation
scores = tl.full([BLOCK_SIZE_SEQ], value=-float('inf'))
for k_idx in range(seq_len):
    key = tl.load(...)  # Load one key
    score = tl.sum(query * key) * scale  # One dot product
    scores = tl.where(condition, score, scores)  # Update one position

# NEW: Parallel computation
all_keys = tl.load(k_ptrs, mask=...)  # Load ALL keys
scores = tl.sum(query[None, :] * all_keys, axis=1) * scale  # ALL dot products
```

### Vectorized Output Computation

```python
# OLD: Sequential weighted sum
output = tl.zeros([BLOCK_SIZE_DIM])
for v_idx in range(seq_len):
    value = tl.load(...)  # Load one value
    weight = get_attention_weight(v_idx)  # Get one weight
    output += weight * value  # Add one contribution

# NEW: Parallel weighted sum
all_values = tl.load(v_ptrs, mask=...)  # Load ALL values
output = tl.sum(attn_weights[:, None] * all_values, axis=0)  # Vectorized sum
```

## 🧪 Correctness Verification

Our vectorized implementation maintains perfect accuracy:

```bash
✅ Correctness Test Results:

## 🔧 Practical Tips

### Broadcasting Best Practices

```python

query[None, :]           # [1, d_model] for row broadcasting
attn_weights[:, None]    # [seq_len, 1] for column broadcasting
all_keys                 # [seq_len, d_model] target shape
```

### Memory Loading Patterns

```python
# Efficient 2D loading
ptrs = base_ptr + outer_offsets[:, None] * stride + inner_offsets[None, :]
data = tl.load(ptrs, mask=outer_mask[:, None] & inner_mask[None, :])
```

### Block Size Selection

```python
# Auto-adjust block sizes
BLOCK_SIZE_SEQ = 128
while BLOCK_SIZE_SEQ < seq_len:
    BLOCK_SIZE_SEQ *= 2  # Ensure block fits data
